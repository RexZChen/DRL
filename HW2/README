Dear Grader(s):

My previous problems are now addressed.
Previous mistakes are now fixed after discussion with several classmates and TA.
    [1] Now the covariance will be updated as the training goes on. (some small mistakes related to torch.tensor() and torch.as_tensor())
    [2] I rewrote my replay_buffer class to make my work cleaner.
    [3] I rewrote PPO with several individual functions to make the calculation process easier.
I would like to especially thank Haotian Xue for his helps during this assignment,
I referred a lot to his ideas after our discussion before doing this assignment.
So, we can promise that we completed our homework individually, independently and separately.

There were a lot of related files to store parameters, but to reduce the uploading time and save space,
I deleted all of them and just left the best threes for three different settings.

Running these files can really take time(on my laptop with 8G RAM at least): STEP 0 ~40mins, STEP 1 ~55mins, STEP 2 ~68mins.

Thanks for your time and your understanding!
